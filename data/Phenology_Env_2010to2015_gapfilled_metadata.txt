Metadata for "Theobald, Breckheimer, and HilleRisLambers. 2017. Climate drives phenological reassembly of a mountain wildflower meadow community. In press. Ecology". Please refer to the paper and supplement for more details.Data collection was supervised by Elli Theobald at the University of Washington (ellij@u.washington.edu), and it is shared under the MIT License.The dataset "Phenology_Env_2010to2015_gapfilled.csv" represents periodic (approximately weekly) observations of plant phenology for a community of 48 species distributed across 71 1 sq. m plots in Mt. Rainier National Park, along with associated environmental covariates.Column	Type	Unit	ExplanationYear	Numeric	Calendar Year	Year of data collectionSite	String	None	Unique code for each 1m phenology plotSDDDOY	Numeric	Day of Year	Day of Year of Last Snow CoverGDD_end	Numeric	Day of Year	Day of year that was the last used to compute growing degree daysDOY	Numeric	Day of Year	Day of year of observationSurveyWeek	Numeric	Weeks	Week of observation relative to the start of the field seasonSoilMoistMeasure	Numeric	Proportion	Measured volumetric water content (average of 4 field measurements per plot visit)Elevation	Numeric	Meters	Approximate elevation of siteTopo	Categorical	None	"Topographic position r=ridge, s=slope,c=cove"Species	String	None	Scientific name of speciesVeg	Numeric	Percentage	Vegetation Cover PercentageNumBud	Numeric	Count	Number of BudsNumFlwr	Numeric	Count	Number of FlowersNumScFlwr	Numeric	Count	Number of Senescing FlowersNumFruit	Numeric	Count	Number of Ripening FruitsNumDispFruit	Numeric	Count	Number of Dispersing FruitsPercBud	Numeric	Percentage	Percent in BudPercFlwr	Numeric	Percentage	Percent in FlowerPercScFlwr	Numeric	Percentage	Percent Senecing FlowerPercFruit	Numeric	Percentage	Percent Ripening FruitPercDispFruit	Numeric	Percentage	Percent Dispersing FruitPercRepro	Numeric	Percentage	Percent in a reproductive phaseTotNumStalks	Numeric	Count	Total number of reproductive stemssnow_cover_duration	Numeric	Days	Number of days covered by snow in current water yearminimum_soil_temp	Numeric	Celcius	Minimum soil temperature in current water yearsource	Categorical	None	Was the snow dissapearance date measured or estimated?species_added	Categorical	None	Was the species added to the dataset later?observation_added	Categorical	None	Was the observation added to the dataset later?firstweek	Categorical	None	dss	Numeric	Days	Days since snow melt of observationLogMoist	Numeric	Log(VWC)	Log-transformed soil moisture at current dayfdd50	Numeric	Unitless	Freezing-degree days in the 50 days after snow meltgdd50	Numeric	Unitless	Growding-degree days in the 50 days after snow meltfrost	Categorical	None	Was there frost in the 50 days after snow melt?moist_days	Numeric	Days	Estimated number of days between snow melt, and the drawdown of soil moisture to 5% VWCSpecies_num	Categorical	None	Numeric code for speciesmaxpercflwrsiteyr	Numeric	Percentage	Maximum percent in flower for a species in the current yearminpercflwrsiteyr	Numeric	Percentage	Minimum percent in flower for a species in the current year
